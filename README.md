# CISC4750 PROGRAMMING USING MATLAB
## Dr. T. Strzemecki

This is an advanced class in which MATLAB programming language and its applications to solutions of scientific and engineering problems are discussed. Programming in MATLAB includes input and output of data, algebraic and logical expressions and operators, hierarchy of precedence of operations, all data types including complex numbers and strings, structured and cell arrays, array indexing and array operations, matrices and matrix operations, control structures, loops, script and function m-files, function handles and their use, graphics and plots, MATLAB functions for graphics modifications, interactive figure modifications. Applications of MATLAB to solutions of engineering problems include solutions of systems of linear equations, analysis of electrical circuits, modeling of discrete dynamical systems, Markov chains, population growth, economy input-output models, balancing of chemical reactions. Applications of MATLAB to scientific problems include algorithms for numerical integration and differentiation, polynomial curve fitting, root finding of nonlinear functions, recurrences, Monte Carlo methods, systems of linear differential equations.
